The file used is a dataset designed randomly, containing two columns "x" and "y," which will be used for the clustering process. The file cluster.py contains all the 
functions used for the solution development, while the file interface.py contains the graphical interface. First, you need to import the data file, then generate the 
clusters using the iterative algorithm. Next, select the number of clusters (k) with k-means and generate the clusters using k-means. Finally, visualize the statistics 
of the results from both algorithms.
